									<h4>UNPLANNED, Gujarat</h4>
									<h4>FOUNDER</h4>
									<p>The year 2020 starts with a new venture where I launched my new business with my friends, called "Unplanned," where I plan trips for our clients. Our unique idea was that we have one particular Questions page where we ask customers their interests, hobbies, budget, and many other questions. From the answer from the client, we suggest a good place to visit as we organize tip to toe for them.</p>

										<h3>Responsibility:</h3>
										<p>•	As a founder of this venture, my responsibility is to bring more clients to the business and provide them good facility.</p>
										<p>•	Select different service providers with affordable prices with good service, for example, tie- up with various hotels from other places and convince them to provide an effective rate.</p>
										<p>•	I am getting customer feedback and evaluating a business, Correcting business for a promising future.</p>
										<p>•	We are promoting and expanding business on the digital platform at an affordable price.</p>
										<p>•	Expanding business by adding new places to visit and connecting with a local person of that places.</p>
										
										After six months of success in that field, we launched another venture called "Swamarth," about a learning platform that provides different courses where famous entrepreneurs and pass-out students from "Indian Institute of Technology" came to take lectures to solve the doubts students.
										To better understand the different industries, we organize tours for students as industrial visits as I contact other industries and organize holidays for our clients.
