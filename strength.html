										<img Align="Left" img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" data-position="side" /><p>My name is Parth Desai. Currently, I am pursuing Information Technology & business analyst course from Conestoga college. Like every human, I also have many ups and downs in life, but learning new things from each failure is my priority. I lived in Vadodara city, situated in India, where I have done my schooling and completed my graduation. Now I am residing in Ontario province in Canada.
											<p>	My career started with my father's business, where they have this famous retail chain franchise name "Pepe Jeans," where I used to handle customers and an "ERP" system to evaluate the inventory of the showroom. Where I used to manage the staff of the showroom as a supervisor. Then I have started pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in "Computer science and engineering." While
											   studying, I worked with "Ashlesha Industry," where I have contributed to project and completed my final year project.</p>
											   
										   <p>	After completing my bachelor's with a "First class" grade, I am keen to start my business with the help of my friends. My startup name is "Unplanned," where we attract customers with different deals and plan and choose the destination according to their interests. Last year all tourist businesses were hit by Covid, and we are one of them at that moment; I thought I still need to learn a lot about analysis.</p>
											   
											   I am a versatile personality who likes to lead my team and work on the ground to satisfy customers. I have a good amount of hobbies that I fulfill in my leisure time, like playing chess. I have a good interest in the aviation industry, where I like to read about different planes. I used to play many digital games where I also want to play cricket for outdoor games.

												<h3>Education </h3>
											</header>
											<p>My latest education experience is with Conestoga college, which is situated in Kitchener, Ontario, where I am learning the Post-Graduation diploma course "Information technology & Business analyst," which helps me improve my analytical, visual, and communication skills. This course allows me to learn different databases like SQL, Tools like PowerBI, Giphi, Microsoft office, especially excel, where I have completed other assignments creating flow charts and perform To-Be analysis. To find detailed data from the database, I used to perform queries in SQL.

												<p>I completed my graduation in "Computer Science & Engineering" From ITM University (GTU), where I learned different types of maths and learned about my core field. I learned and developed various projects in various languages like C, C++, Javascript, Java, Advance Java, .NET, Python, SQL. I did multiple projects while completing my study like "Advance attendance system" and "Database Management." While conducting my research, I also take part in competitions like "Hackathon," "Quizzes," Google certification," Android Master," and I also completed some advanced certifications in .NET Learning. For my last year's project, I got an internship in "Ashlesha LTD." where I developed
											    my project in the .NET language. The title for that project is "Blind Job Portal," where I developed a web application to help blind or partially blind people to access that website.</p>
												
												
												<p> completed my schooling at "Sardar Vallabhbhai Vidhyalay" school because this school comes from one of India's famous freedom fighters; as that person school taught me to discipline in time and life. I learn basic science, Maths, Social Sciences, but I also understand different games to keep physical and mental health happy.</p>
